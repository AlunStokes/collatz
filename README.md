# Self-Contained Numbers
## Distributed Julia Programs to search for Self-Contained Numbers (which have significant relevance to the Collatz conjecture)

Quackery aside, we did manage to, by use of Compute Canada servers, improve the known upper bound on known self-contained numbers from 10^11 to 10^15 (took about 100 compute-years). No claims of vast efficiency are made. Can be found at [OEIS entry A005184](https://oeis.org/A005184)
